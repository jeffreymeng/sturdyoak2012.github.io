	<h4> What's up?</h4>
	<p>This is my website!  I think there's some cool stuff here, but that's up for interpretation.  I think everybody else's website is pretty boring, so you'll probably say the same for mine.</p>

	For stuff about me you can see my <a href="about.html">about page</a>.
	<br><br>
	If you'd like to see pictures you can find one on my <a href="pictures.html">pictures page</a>.
	<br><br>
	I like to do some outdoor stuff, like backpacking, climbing, and cycling.  If you'd like to see more stuff about that, including a lot of trip reports from my "adventures", you can see my <a href="outdoors.html">outdoors page</a>.
	<br><br>
	When I'm bored in class I draw small comics.  The collection is small right now (classes aren't <i>that</i> bad) but it will get larger once teachers stop breathing down my neck.  Find them <a href="comics.html">here</a>!

	For the really boring stuff about me refer to my <a href="physics.html">physics page</a>.
