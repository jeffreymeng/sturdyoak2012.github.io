	I'm in high school right now, and I live in Cupertino, CA.  
	<br><br>I like backpacking, biking, watching soccer (FCB!), and watching Friends.  
	<br><br>
	I don't like chocolate, computer science, homework, French people, French things, Ariana Grande, pencils, non-swivel chairs, Elon Musk, podcasts, computer stickers, toast, indoor heating, sunscreen, oily hands, rap, school clubs, volunteer hours, Stanford, Harvard, trees, biology, KPOP, and Kevin Hart.

	Some of my more "professional" activities (really not so much about me is professional) include tutoring students for AP Physics and the USA Physics Olympiad.  I hope to join the USA National Physics Team and represent the USA at the International Physics Olympiad.  In college, I would like to study physics!

	If you would like to contact me, jacobnie2008@gmail.com is my email.  (I welcome questions about route information!  Always happy to share information with other backpackers.)
